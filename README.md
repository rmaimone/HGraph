# HGraph
Hgraph is a a visual representation of a patient's health status. Here http://www.hgraph.org you can find all information about Hgraph and you can download source code to use it in a web project.

I devloped a simple Hgraph library for android and in this example I used it to represent the user's adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, within a mobile application that aims to motivate people to adopt an healthy lifestyle.

How use this module:

add the module in your android application
create a class where you laod the list of data to represent and the HScore
